Supermarket checkout exercise using Test Driven Development
This exercise was provided for me to try at a Meetup with Code and Stuff and Python North West
on 20th Feb 2020.  I worked with mentors from Python North West during the meetup to learn about
Test Driven Development in developing the Python code.
I completed the exercise, developing tests to drive development of the final version

The exercise requirements:
Implement the code for a supermarket checkout that calculates the total price of a number of items.
Goods are priced individually, however there are weekly special offers for when multiple items are bought.
For example "Apples are 50 each or 3 for 130"

 SKU  Unit Price  Special Offer
 A99  50          3 for 130
 B15  30          2 for 45
 C40  60      
 T34  99
